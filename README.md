# Christian Slater's Mr. Robot patch

## The screencap

The patch recreation started from this screencap:

![Screencap](artwork/patch-capture.png?raw=true "Patch screencap")

## The desgin

![Design](artwork/patch-design.png?raw=true "Patch design")

The MR. ROBOT patch text and show logo is essentially the
[NiseSega font](http://www.thealmightyguru.com/GameFonts/Series-Sega.html)
created by fan HariHariSonic with a modified 'B'. For the patch, the center
line is thickened and colored in.

The "Computer Repair with a Smile" font appears to be the 
[Giuluio Bold](http://www.fontspring.com/fonts/fontsite/giulio) font which can
be purchased quite reasonably.

The robot image in the center was created by placing a grid over the screen
capture of the patch and tracing over the robot in blocks, much like in
[this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Se7WVuyIEnU). The contiguous
blocks of each color were then combined into a single path.

## Actual Patch

The thread color choices were from the lsacord color chart as follows:

* Dark Grey/Border = (Charcoal - 0111)
* Red = Darker Red (Special Red - 1902)
* Light Grey (Sterling - 0124)
* Yellow = (Yellow - 0600)

The patch size, 4"x2.5" was chosen based on the embroidery shop's available
blanks. It is a little too wide for its height.

## Christian Slater's jacket

![Jacket comparison](artwork/jacket-comparison.jpg?raw=true "Jacket comparison")

The jacket worn by Christian Slater appears to be an Eisenhower-style uniform
jacket produced by Eastern Uniform in the 80s. Eastern Uniform no longer exists
and the jacket does not appear to still be produced. The jacket appears to be
very similar in form to the Cintas Ike Jacket - 971 which is not available in
brown or with a red lining.feel like you have the ;powers of elliot alderson ;)
